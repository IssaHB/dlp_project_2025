## Galaxy Morphological Classification with Zernike Moments and Machine Learning Approaches

The code in this repository is largely based on the paper ["Galaxy Morphological Classification with Zernike Moments and Machine Learning Approaches"](https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4365/ada8ab) by Ghaderi et al. (2025). It was modified and extended by Florine H. J. Koch, Isa Chousein Basia, and Madalena Nunes De Lima as part of a group project for the "Deep Learning in Physics" graduate-level course offered by the University of Groningen, The Netherlands. 

## Data
The data files are accessible from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pwNk-8VJ-a_jUn84DyPYRYmhYSmki1dh) and include two categories:

- galaxy-nongalaxy
- galaxy
  
Each category contains two folders:

- images: This folder includes the original images for galaxy-nongalaxy and cropped images for galaxy classifiers.
- ZMs: This folder contains Zernike Moments (ZMs) data sets in CSV file format.
